## Course Objectives

The objective of the course is to expose students to common issues and techniques in applied microeconomics as well as recent advances in this area. The goal is to teach students how to use these techniques concretely and be capable of reading and critiquing applied work in the economics and management literature.

## Course Structure

Each session includes:
- **Lecture:** 1h30-2h
- **Application:** 1h-1h30

**Note:** Students are required to bring their laptops and have STATA installed.

## Grading

The grade will be based on a final exam.
